#React Native Online Meetups

So I came with this crazy idea about doing online meetups on React Native.

### How I see it:

1. Every month or so, we get 4-5 speakers per meetup.
2. Every session will last around for an hour.
3. I mainly would like to see what people are working on, whether it's a library, side project app, or some hack you want to share with others.
4. Meetups will be live streamed and recorded.
5. More to follow, stay tuned!

## UPCOMING MEETUPS

Please PR `interestedSpeakers.md` if you'd like to speak. I'd love to hear what you're working on!
